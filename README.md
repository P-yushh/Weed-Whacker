AGRICULTURE (Weed Identification & Classification)-- FALL_FEST


Robotic weed control has seen increased research of late with its potential for boosting
productivity in agriculture. Majority of works focus on developing robotics for croplands,
ignoring the weed management problems facing rangeland stock farmers.


Due to lack of knowledge, farmers face many problems regarding weed control like stock
injury, poisoning, unwanted growth etc. These problems can be dealt with if farmers can be
provided with relevant information on the query plant.


Solution to the problem, our project is aimed to create a Convolutional Neural Network
based deep-learning model to identify weed plants instantly by just using one or two
pictures of the plant. Ready to use, the whole system will be integrated into a simple-to-use
app.


By simply pointing your phone at the plant and a few snaps, the app will tell you whether the
pointed plant is a weed or not along with full description of the plant to help farmers deal
with it.
